    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology converts written text into spoken words. It is used in a variety of applications, including:\n",
    "- Virtual assistants\n",
    "- Accessibility tools for visually impaired individuals\n",
    "- Audiobook creation\n",
    "- Multilingual voice applications\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI provides a powerful TTS API that enables developers to create high-quality, natural-sounding speech from text."

    "## How Does TTS Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "TTS systems typically involve the following components:\n",
    "1. **Text Analysis**: Breaks text into smaller linguistic units (e.g., sentences, words).\n",
    "2. **Phoneme Conversion**: Converts text into phonemes, the basic sound units of speech.\n",
    "3. **Waveform Generation**: Synthesizes audio waveforms for the phonemes using a speech model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern TTS models, like those used by OpenAI, leverage deep learning techniques such as transformer architectures to generate highly natural speech."

    "2. **API Key**: Obtain an API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/). Workshop-Team is happy to provide this, of course... :) \n",
    "3. **Audio Output Library** (Optional): Install `pydub` for audio playback.\n",

    "### Challenges:\n",
    "- **Latency**: Real-time speech generation can be slow for long texts.\n",
    "- **Customization**: Limited options for voice customization compared to some dedicated TTS tools.\n",
    "- **Cost**: Using the API extensively can incur significant costs. OpenAI: 15$ per 1M tokens TTS-ed but: 1 million tokens is a lot. A simple calculation: rule of thumb is 4 characters per token, on average, and 6 characters per word, which would put 1M tokens to ~670,000 words or ~1300 book-pages. Take-away: be careful anyways :) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices:\n",
    "- Use short sentences for real-time applications to reduce latency.\n",
    "- Cache audio files if the same text is used repeatedly.\n",
    "- Choose the appropriate voice model for your application.\n"

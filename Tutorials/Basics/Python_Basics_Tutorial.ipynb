    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains, such as:\n",
    "- **Web Development** (e.g., using Django or Flask)\n",
    "- **Data Science** (e.g., using Pandas, NumPy, or Matplotlib)\n",
    "- **Machine Learning and AI** (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch)\n",
    "- **Automation and Scripting**\n",
    "- **Game Development** (e.g. pygame)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Wait what?\n",
    "In simple terms this is a widely adopted and more or less easy to learn programming language. At least with the help of ai you should be able to bring your projects and ideas to life fast.\n",
    "Python is organized in skript files (.py) and in those files you put your code following a certain structure, of course- programming is about learning a language. But you don't have to do all on your own: in python there a pre-coded scripts and packages called libraries (often also called dependencies). These libraries or libs you can download, install, import, customize, etc. ...pretty helpful!\n",
    "And, last but not least for the basics: you can't break anything because python provides solutions to \"capsule\" your so called \"virtual environment\" or \"venv\" speaking in coool language (this means your project and all libs on one place- e.g. for reproducing / sharing or in case you need to go back to a working state when you break something). Now lets see a simple script that shows all the mentioned stuff besides the:"

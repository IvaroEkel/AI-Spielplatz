# Object Detection

This tutorial will introduce you to some concepts you need to know to understand how good (or bad) and object detection model is detecting objects.

## What will you learn in this lesson?
1. How to connect a camera to a Raspberry Pi.
2. Use a pre-trained model to perform object detection.
3. Visualize the detections (and what are bounding boxes).
4. Analyze how good (or bad) is your model with metrics (IoU, precision and recall -> Rafael Padilla tutorial: https://github.com/rafaelpadilla/Object-Detection-Metrics).
